# Enumeration of Bell Inequalities up to Symmetries
This directory contains files for running  *RANDA* to enumerate all faces for a two party setting of a Bell setting.
Additionally, it generates the script for GAP to check for equivalences during the enumeration.

### **gap_program_templates.py**
Templates for the GAP programs that are generated by the **enumerate_bell_polytope.py** script. You don't need to
execute this file at any point.

### **enumerate_bell_polytope.py**
Script to enumerate a Bell polytope. As arguments you have to give the number of inputs/outputs for the two parties.
The program calls RANDA and GAP for the calculation. You can also give the type of symmetry you need for the calculation.

For example to enumerate the Bell polytope with binary inputs and outputs call:
```shell
python enumerate_bell_polytope.py 2 2 2 2
```
All options for this scripted are displayed if you call 

```shell
python enumerate_bell_polytope.py -h
```
