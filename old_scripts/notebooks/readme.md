# Notebooks
Here I provide an overview over the *Jupyter notebooks* that are provided within this repository. 

* **bell_inequalities.ipynb** - An introduction on how to find Bell inequalities by linear programming
* **binary_outcome.ipynb** - Finding Bell inequalities with arbitrary number of inputs and binary outcome. And extension to a 3-outcome model, for inefficient detectors.
* **check_facet.ipynb** - Demonstration on how to find a facet bell inequality in a 2 inputs / 2 outputs case.
