# Small scripts
A collection of small scripts.

## *matrix_to_vector_representation.py*
Converting matrix representation of Bell inequalities to vector form. This deals with Bell inequalities from 
[this website](https://www-users.york.ac.uk/~rc973/Bell). 
To see usage options use:
```shell
python matrix_to_vector_representation.py -h
```

## *merge_inequalities.py*
If you have two files with inequalities for one polytope, you can use this script to merge both files.
You need to give both input files and an output file as arguments.

## *problem_sizes.py*
Calculates the characteristics of a Bell polytope. You need to give number of inputs and outputs.
