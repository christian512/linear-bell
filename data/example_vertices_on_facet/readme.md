This directory includes examples for vertices on the facet, which are
generated by Adjacency decomposition by PANDA. We want to use this data
to check, if we can find a faster algorithm than Fourier-Motzkin-Elimination 
to find the H-representation from the given V-representation.

In the raw files I just store the data directly outputted by PANDA, for
vertices on facet. The last entry is probably just the divisor.
