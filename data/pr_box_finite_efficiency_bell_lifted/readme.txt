This directory contains files that hold the bell inequalities that can be lifted in a way that the 3 output version
of the PR box, where the 3rd outcome is a failure, violates this bell inequality. The efficiency for the PR box
is chosen to be "4 / (m+4) + 0.01". Thus it's just before the threshold where the PR box should become local.

What we've shown with that is, that there exist lifted bell expressions from the mm22 case, that are violated by the
PR box for "eta > 4 / (m+4)". However this only holds for some m and not for all.
If we can not find such a lifted bell expression, the corresponding file is just empty.
