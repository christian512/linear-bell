# Bell Inequalities from Linear Programming
In this repository, I try to explain the usage of linear programming, for finding Bell inequalities, for a given 
probability distribution. I follow the paper *Bell nonlocality* by *Brunner et. al. (2014)*, which can be found on the [*arXiv*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.2849).

The connection between Bell inequalities and linear programming interested me, so I though a short python demo would be
good to learn about the topic by myself. This repo is just what I've done to understand it better. Maybe it helps someone.
