# Equivalence tests

## **equivalence_test.py**
Checks if the given facets of a Bell polytope are equivalent under the relabeling symmetry group 
and (optionally) writes the facet-classes to a new file. As inputs you need to provide the number of
inputs/outputs and the path to the facet file (PANDA/RANDA) format.

For example, you can call this script on a file provided with this repository by:

```shell
python
