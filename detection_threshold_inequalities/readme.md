This directory contains codes for finding Bell Inequalities in a lifted form for the finite efficiency PR-Box with 3 possible outcomes.
We apply Linear Programs to find Bell Inequalities and check for every possible lifting if such a Bell Inequality exists.

* **fully_lifted_fineff_pr.py** - Searches for Inequalities where the failure output is treated equally to one valid output for every input.

* **partial_lifted_fineff_pr.py** - Searches for Inequalities where the failure output is only for some inputs treated equally to a valid output.

* **partial_lifted_symmetric_fineff_pr.py** - Searches for Inequalities where the failure output is only for some inputs treated equally to a valid output.
Additionally the liftings is required to be symmetric, i.e. applied equally to both parties.
